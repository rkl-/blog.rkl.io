Today happened something epic. This morning I tried to pay on a gas
station with my [Bitwala](https://www.bitwala.com/) Visa PrePaid
Card and the transaction was declined. Let us forget that this
was an embarrassing situation and that my card balance was topped
up. That card was simply blocked by the partner of Bitwala, [MyChoice
Corporate](https://mychoicecorporate.com/). But why?

After trying to reach MyChoice's customer service and got nothing more as
a synthetic voice which told me that my card was cancleled and I should
order a new one, I tried to figure out more details from Bitwala's side
and found them at their official Twitter account.

*Following an announcement from our card issuer on behalf of Visa Europe,
Bitwala cards are taken out of operation starting today. Our team is
holding an emergency meeting to resolve the issue with the card holders
best interest in mind and will make an update shortly.*

Well, at this time, Bitwala is heavily working on a solution
and I absolutly trust this company. But, the reason is
really interesting.  Officially it seems that the partner
[Wavecrest](https://www.wavecrest.gi/) is the problem here, because currently
all issued cards in conncection to Wavecrest are affected.

However, this could also be the beginning of active firering on crypto
partners by VISA. Are they in fear? This is really speculative but another
big plus for avoiding banks and use real crypto currencies. Not things
like Ripple, I mean real crpyto currencies.

Well, at this moment we only can wait for official accouncements. Not
only Bitwala is affected, also TenX and others.

What could you do else? Be patient and do not DoS your customer support,
their heads are full now to find a solution for us, their customers.
